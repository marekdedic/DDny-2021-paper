\section{Introduction}

\todo{R1: It is very difficult to understand the concrete goal of the paper. It is important to describe the added value of the proposed framework comparing with the existing HARP method.}
Graph-based models for machine learning are often used for task with millions of nodes and billions of edges. For such tasks, many machine learning algorithms may be computationally intractable. As a way to combat these growing demands, we look at the trade-off between performance, complexity and method generality. Our work in progress builds on HARP \cite{chen_harp_2018} and proposes a general framework for coarsening graphs and examines the performance characteristics of models trained on these coarser graphs.

In the next section, the graph learning algorithm HARP is presented, followed by a section presenting partially injective homomorphisms. Section \ref{sec:harp-as-pihom} connects these ideas and Section \ref{sec:performance-vs-complexity} discusses the performance characteristics of HARP. Finally, Section \ref{sec:experiments} supports our theses with experimental evaluation.
